## Relevant Papers
- [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602)
- [Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236)
	* amazing how just adding a couple of lines of code to use a seperate target network dramatically increased stability

## TODO
- [x] implement base dqn
- [x] implement tgt network
- [ ] implement rest of changes from human-level paper
- [ ] mess around with hyperparameters to find best set
- [ ] get pixel network to work at least on one atari game
- [ ] see if pixel network will work on cartpole/lunar-lander
